# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is organized in its own directory, named after the problem, and contains a detailed README with the problem description, my solution, and additional resources for better understanding.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is stored in a separate directory with the following structure:

```
leetcode/
│
├── Problem-Name-1/
│ ├── Problem-Name-1.py
│ ├── README.md
│
├── Problem-Name-2/
│ ├── Problem-Name-2.py
│ ├── README.md
│
├── Problem-Name-3/
│ ├── Problem-Name-3.py
│ ├── README.md
│
└── ...
```


- `Problem-Name-X.py`: This file contains my implementation of the solution for the problem.
- `README.md`: This file contains the problem's description, my solution approach, and helpful resources.

## Example Directory Structure

For instance, if we have solved the problem "2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions," the directory structure will look like this:

```
leetcode/
│
├── create_binary_tree_from_descriptions_2196/
│ ├── create_binary_tree_from_descriptions_2196.py
│ ├── README.md
│
...
```

## Problem README Template

Each `README.md` file follows a template that includes:

1. **Problem Description**: Detailed description of the problem as provided by LeetCode.
2. **Solution**: Explanation of the approach and logic used to solve the problem.
3. **Hints**: Any hints or tips that were useful in solving the problem.
4. **Resources**: Links to YouTube videos or other resources that can help in understanding the problem better.
